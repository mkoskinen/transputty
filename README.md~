==========

TransPutty - PuTTy patched for crude pseudotransparency

Based on Putty 0.63 and robymus's original transputty patch, from around ~2001.

Hastily compiled on Visual Studio 2012. Requires a background bitmap to be made manually (a file named 'putty.bmp'
in the path of the executable, apply tints etc there if needed).

I understand there are much better transparency implementations available, so please check for those.
For most things I've migrated away from Windows, so I likely won't keep this up to date very actively.
Apologies for the poor git history as well.

0.63 binary available at: http://www.markuskoskinen.com/files/transputty.exe

All the best,
-Markus
